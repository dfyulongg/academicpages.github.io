I am a PhD student at the [Division of Decision and Control Systems](https://www.kth.se/dcs) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) under the supervision of [Prof. Karl Henrik Johansson](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/index.html) (KTH) and [Prof. Lihua Xie](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/elhxie/) (NTU).  Before that, I earned a B.E. degree in Automation in 2013 and an M.E. degree in Control Science and Engineering in 2016 under the supervision of [Prof. Yuanqing Xia](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=HtedN3oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), both from [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn/index.htm). I visited [Prof. Alessandro Abate](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandro.abate/home.html) as a visiting student at [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) in 2019. My research interests include MPC, networked control systems, formal verification, and stochastic control with application to safety-critical systems and human-in-the-loop systems.
